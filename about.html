    <p id="about-me">
        i come from the tech hub of kitchener, ontario, canada. i grew up on the internet and alongside computers and electronics, so it was natural for me to want to learn to code and do cool things with computers and electronics.
        i'm currently studying a program called "engineering systems and computing" at the University of Guelph, which lets me dabble in all those things and more.
        my co-op terms have focused primarily on software development. currently, my co-op at Clear Software is a full-stack developer role working on an application in made with React, Typescript, GraphQL, and MariaDB. 
        in the fall, i'm heading back to my hometown to work for <a href="https://www.d2l.com/"></a>, who make the course management tool for hundreds of universities and colleges (including my own!)
        <br>
        in my spare time, i'm probably whipping up a personal project, playing around with mechanical keyboards, gaming, heading to a local concert, exploring nature, or making my own music.

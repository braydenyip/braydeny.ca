    <p id="about-me">
        👨🏻‍💻⚙   I come from the tech hub of Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. I grew up on the internet and alongside computers and electronics, so it was natural for me to want to learn to code and do cool things with computers and electronics.
        Over the last few years, as I've worked through my co-ops and degree program, I've realized that I have a passion for tackling interesting projects, learning new technologies, and bringing a creative design approach to engineering tasks.
        I've worked with a variety of employers of different shapes and sizes, from Fortune 500-listed companies to small local development shops, working across the tech stack.

        🚀✈   One of my biggest passions is the field of aerospace . I'm currently a member of the Gryphon Aerospace Club at the University of Guelph, where I work on the controls and software guiding our unmanned aerial vehicle program. In May 2024, we competed in Alma, Quebec, in our debut at the AEAC UAS National Student Competition.
        Despite setbacks and our limited budget and experience, we were able to fly successfully and won an award for our perseverance and dedication along the way. We're hoping to be back even stronger next year, with all our new found knowledge and experience.

        🎧🧗‍♂️   In my spare time, i'm probably whipping up a personal project, playing with mechanical keyboards, gaming, making music, volunteering with campus radio, or bouldering at the local climbing gym!
